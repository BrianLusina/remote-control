A basic remote control built with Pug view engine & NodeJS

## Prerequisites

A couple of things you will need:

1. [Node](https://nodejs.org/en/) & [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) or [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/)   
    
   Node is necessary to run the current project. NPM or Yarn will be used to install the required dependencies needed by
   this project. 
    
2. [xdotool](https://www.semicomplete.com/projects/xdotool/#installing)
   
   This is necessary to simulate Keyboard & mouse inputs. Depending on your OS architecture, the installation instructions
   in the provided link should be enough to get you started.

## Getting started

Once you have everything above setup, now all you need to do is the following:

Install required dependencies wither with `npm` or with `yarn`

``` bash
npm install
# or
yarn
```

Aftewards, you start the dev server:

```bash
npm start
# or
yarn start
```

You should now see something as below:

|Home Page  | Netflix|  YouTube | Amazon Prime Video | Generic/Music PLayer  |
|---|---|---|---|---|
