# Remote Control

A basic remote control built with Pug view engine & NodeJS

## Prerequisites

A couple of things you will need:

1. [Node](https://nodejs.org/en/) & [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) or [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/)   
    
   Node is necessary to run the current project. NPM or Yarn will be used to install the required dependencies needed by
   this project. 
    
2. [xdotool](https://www.semicomplete.com/projects/xdotool/#installing)
   
   This is necessary to simulate Keyboard & mouse inputs. Depending on your OS architecture, the installation instructions
   in the provided link should be enough to get you started.
